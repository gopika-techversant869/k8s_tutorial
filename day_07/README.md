How can we setup k8s 
-----------------------
In Kubernetes, the cluster type generally refers to how and where the cluster is set up. There are a few common types of Kubernetes clusters, depending on the environment:

1. Local Clusters
   ------------------------
   
Used for development or testing on your local machine.

        Kind (Kubernetes IN Docker): Runs Kubernetes clusters in Docker containers.
        
        Minikube: Runs a single-node Kubernetes cluster in a VM or container locally.
        
        K3s: Lightweight Kubernetes for edge or IoT, can be used locally too.

ðŸ”¹ 2. Self-Managed (On-Premises or Bare Metal)
----------------------------------------------------
  You install and manage the cluster yourself on physical or virtual servers.
        
  More control, but more maintenance.
  
  Common for private data centers or regulated environments.

ðŸ”¹ 3. Cloud-Managed Kubernetes Services
-------------------------------------------
Provided and maintained by cloud vendors â€” easy to set up, scale, and maintain.

          Amazon EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service)
          
          Google GKE (Google Kubernetes Engine)
          
          Azure AKS (Azure Kubernetes Service)
          
          DigitalOcean Kubernetes
          
          IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service

ðŸ”¹ 4. Hybrid or Multi-Cloud Clusters
-----------------------------------------------
  Mix of cloud and on-prem resources.
  
  Tools like Rancher, Anthos, or OpenShift help manage hybrid clusters.
  
  Useful for redundancy, compliance, or data locality.
